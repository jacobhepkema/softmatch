# SoftMatch

Welcome to the SoftMatch documentation. SoftMatch is a high-performance Python toolkit for fuzzy matching of adapter sequences in FASTQ files.

## Key Features

- **Fuzzy Matching**: Uses the powerful `regex` library to find adapter sequences with a configurable number of errors (mismatches, insertions, deletions).
- **IUPAC Support**: Seamlessly handles IUPAC ambiguous bases in your query sequences.
- **Multiprocessing**: Automatically utilizes multiple CPU cores to process large FASTQ files quickly.
- **Rich Visualizations**: Generates interactive HTML reports and clustered summaries to help you understand your data.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Visualizations are designed with a modern, clean look inspired by professional sequence viewers.

## Why SoftMatch?

SoftMatch is designed for researchers who need to quickly identify and visualize the presence of adapters or other fixed sequences in their sequencing data, even when those sequences might contain sequencing errors or biological variations.
